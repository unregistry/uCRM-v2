[SuiteCRM](https://suitecrm.com) is the award-winning open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application.

Our vision is to be the most adopted open source enterprise CRM in the world, giving users full control of their data and freedom to own and customise their business solution.

SuiteCRM 7 is a mature and stable CRM with a large community and regular releases containing new features, security patches and bug fixes from both our community and the SuiteCRM team.

You may also be interested in [SuiteCRM 8](https://github.com/SuiteCRM/SuiteCRM-Core) the latest version of SuiteCRM. At the time of writing, SuiteCRM 8 is in the levelling up phase and not yet as feature complete. More information is available on the [SuiteCRM Journey ](https://suitecrm.com/the-suitecrm-8-journey/).

### Getting Started

SuiteCRM 7 is compatible with most Linux and Windows servers. Test and development servers can be deployed locally, however for best performance and compatibility we recommend hosting on a linux based server with a properly configured LAMP Stack. As SuiteCRM is based on standard technologies like Apache, PHP and MySQL, the CRM can be self-hosted on your own internal network, on a public cloud provider or on a fully managed hosting service.

#### Key System Requirements
* **Web Server:** Apache (recommended) or IIS
* **PHP:** 8.1 - 8.4
* **Database:** MySQL or MariaDB (recommended) or MSSQL

Please see our [Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.suitecrm.com/admin/compatibility-matrix/) and [Installation Guide](https://docs.suitecrm.com/admin/installation-guide/downloading-installing/) for more detail.

SuiteCRM Ltd, the authors and maintainers of SuiteCRM offer a range of [fully managed hosting](https://suitecrm.com/suitecrmhosted/) services. These are ideal for organisations who don't have the in house knowledge or experience to host and maintain the application and are a great way to support the future development of the project.

### Demo

We have a demo of SuiteCRM 7 available online, allowing you to easily try the CRM and some of its features.

Try out our demo here: [Click here to visit the SuiteCRM Demo](https://suitecrm.com/demo/)

The demo rebuilds every hour, so any changes made will be removed automatically on a regular basis. Please note the demo is public so don't upload any personal information.

### Updating SuiteCRM

To benefit from the latest security and bugfixes as well as the most comprehensive feature set, we recommend all users upgrade to the latest ESR release at their earliest opportunity. See our [upgrade documentation](https://docs.suitecrm.com/admin/installation-guide/upgrading/) for more detail.
